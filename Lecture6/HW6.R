#Compute the probability that the driver of a car is texting at a specific intersection.
# Nationally the cumulative probability that a driver is texting is:
# P = 0.5, at x = 0.1
# P = 0.75 at x = 0.3

#  Given these data
#   Compute the Beta prior, and report the coefficients
library(LearnBayes)

#Setting the Beta Prior
# Nationally the *cumulative probability* that a driver is texting is:
# P = 0.5, at x = 0.1
# P = 0.75 at x = 0.3 -> Cumulative Probability hence p=0.25 at x = 0.3

beta.prior = beta.select(list(p = 0.5, x = 0.1), list(p = 0.75, x = 0.3))
